# Android-app
The purpose of the Art Gallery App is to provide art fans with a virtual space to see, analyse, and interact with a variety of artworks created by artists across the globe. By enabling users to find and share art whenever it's convenient, the app seeks to solve the issue of traditional art galleries and museums being inaccessible to some. Users can customise their art exploration, make profiles, and take advantage of a pleasant interface that features excellent artwork photos. The Art Gallery App aims to promote connection and appreciation of creativity by making art more accessible to a wider audience with features including user galleries, artist profiles, and comprehensive metadata.
